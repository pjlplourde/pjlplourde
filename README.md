### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am a C# developer in the .NET ecosystem using multiple .NET and related technologies. I am committed to building modular, scalable, and well-documented applications with the end user's needs in mind, whether that's a requirement for a minimum viable product (MVP), a full featured applicaation, or bug fixes, feature enhancements, or documentation on an existing project. I have experience building applications using most project types in C#, including console applications, class libraries, WinForms, Windows Presentation Foundation, ASP.NET Razor Pages web applications, ASP.NET Model-View-Controller (MVC) web applications, ASP.NET APIs, Blazor Server applications, and Blazor WebAssembly.

I also have extensive experience as a database administrator using SQL Server (primarly Microsoft, but also Oracle to a lesser extent). I have also used MySQL and SQLite in projects, as well as NoSQL solutions such as MongoDB and Azure CosmosDB. I have used both GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines.

While not my primary focus, I have experience as a SuiteScript Developer in the Oracle NetSuite ecosystem, having earned the following certifications:
-	Oracle NetSuite Certified SuiteAnalytics User
-	Oracle NetSuite Certified Financial User
-	Oracle NetSuite Certified SuiteFoundation
-	Oracle NetSuite Certified Administrator
-	Oracle NetSuite Certified SuiteCloud Developer II
-	Oracle NetSuite Certified ERP Consultant

I have a Bachelor of Science degree with Honours in Chemistry from the UniversitÃ© de Moncton, where my focus was on computational and theoretical chemistry. I also have a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of New Brunswick. I have worked as a commercial pilot and flight instructor, a lawyer, a customer service representative, a buyer, a systems manager, and a developer.
