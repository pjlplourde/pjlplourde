### Hi there 👋

## ⚡About Me

I am a C# developer in the .NET ecosystem using multiple .NET and related technologies. I am committed to building modular, scalable, and well-documented applications with the end user's needs in mind, whether that's a requirement for a minimum viable product (MVP), a full featured application, or bug fixes, feature enhancements, or documentation on an existing project. I have experience building applications using most project types in C#, including: Console Apps, Blazor Web Apps, ASP.NET Core Razor Pages Web Apps, ASP.NET Core Web APIs, Class Libraries, Blazor Server Apps, Razor Class Libraries, ASP.NET Core Model-View-Controller Web Apps, Blazor WebAssembly Standalone Apps, Windows Forms Apps, Windows Forms Apps (.NET Framework), WPF Apps, WPF Class Libraries, WPF Apps (.NET Framework), Console Apps (.NET Framework), ASP.NET Web Applications (.NET Framework), Class Libraries (.NET Framework), and xUnit Test Projects. I also have exposure to Azure Functions, ASP.NET Core gRPC Services, Worker Services, .NET MAUI Apps.

I also have extensive experience as a database administrator using SQL Server (primarly Microsoft, but also Oracle to a lesser extent). I have also used MySQL and SQLite in projects, as well as NoSQL solutions such as MongoDB and Azure CosmosDB. I have used both GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines.

To pay the bills, my day jobs have been as a Oracle NetSuite Administrator, Developer, and Consultant. I have  earned the following certifications from Oracle NetSuite:

I have a Bachelor of Science degree with Honours in Chemistry from the Université de Moncton, where my focus was on computational and theoretical chemistry. I also have a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of New Brunswick. I have worked as a commercial pilot and flight instructor, a lawyer, a customer service representative, a buyer, a systems manager, and a developer.

## 🔭 Projects and 👯 Contributions

My projects are divided between this GitHub account, where I keep smaller and personal projects, and my GitHub Organization [Spartan C#](https://github.com/Spartan-CSharp), where my portfolio projects are located.

- I’m currently working on two projects:
	- The [tRNA](https://github.com/Spartan-CSharp/tRNA) app, a project is to convert a C program I did as an undergrad in 93-95 into modern-day C#. The program predicts tRNA secondary structure from the primary structure. Not sure the chemistry is still accurate, but as a coding exercise, this should be a good challenge.
	- The [Gaussian 2](https://github.com/Spartan-CSharp/Gaussian2) app, a C# application & SQL database allow storing and indexing of results of electronic structure calculations performed with the Gaussian series of programs. 

If you want to see more of my work and skills, please visit my website [spartancsharp.net](https://spartancsharp.net). The Portfolio page links to my product showcase, open source contributions, and my learning path.

I am always happy to collaborate on open source projects. If you have a project in mind, please feel free to reach out to me. I also welcome collaboration on my open source projects. Please see the contributing guidelines in each repository for more information.
